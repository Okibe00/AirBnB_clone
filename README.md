## Project description
A command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects
## Output

    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
