## Project Description:
The project aims to create a command interpreter for managing AirBnB objects.
It will allow users to interact with AirBnB objects such as places, users, reviews, and amenities. 
The command interpreter will provide a set of commands to create, update, delete, and display these objects.
## Description of the Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with AirBnB objects through a set of commands. 
It will provide the following functionalities:

Create new objects (places, users, reviews, amenities)
Update existing objects
Delete objects
Display objects
Search and filter objects based on specific criteria
Save and load data to/from a file

## How to Start the Command Interpreter:
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the command interpreter is located.
Run the command interpreter script.


# How to Use the Command Interpreter:
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands to manage AirBnB objects:

    help: Display the list of available commands and their descriptions.
    create <object_type>: Create a new object of the specified type (e.g., place, user, review, amenity).
    update <object_type> <object_id>: Update the attributes of an existing object.
    destroy <object_type> <object_id>: Delete an existing object.
    show <object_type> <object_id>: Display the attributes of an existing object.
    all <object_type>: Display all objects of the specified type.
    search <object_type>  : Search for objects of the specified type that match the given attribute-value pair.
    quit: Exit the command interpreter.
